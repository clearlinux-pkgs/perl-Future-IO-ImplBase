Revision history for Future-IO

0.11    2022-01-07
        [CHANGES]
         * Added ->connect and ->accept for socket-based code
         * Provide ->HAVE_MULTIPLE_FILEHANDLES for user code to check if a
           real impl has been loaded
         * Simplify the default implementation so it can reuse most of the
           ImplBase class
         * Wording fix in docs for ->alarm

0.10    2021-08-26
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Skip the unit test about filling pipes with ->syswrite on MSWin32
           because the test just hangs there (RT138985)

0.09    2021-08-24
        [CHANGES]
         * Added ->waitpid that real event loop implementations can provide

         * Extracted impl tests to shareable Test::Future::IO::Impl module
         * Add links to existing CPAN implementations and test modules

0.07    2020-03-24
        [CHANGES]
         * Make the ->await method wait until the future instance is ready

        [CHANGES]
         * Misc small docs fixes

        [CHANGES]
         * Added ->syswrite and ->syswrite_exactly

         * Provide and document the $IMPL package variable mechanism
